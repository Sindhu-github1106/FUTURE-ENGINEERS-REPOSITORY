Engineering materials
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.

## Introduction

* Submitted at the World Robotics Olympiad Nationals 2022:
* This project was placed 4th Nationwide.
This project is a robotic vehicle that needs to drive autonomously on a parkour that randomly changes each round. I used the Lego MINDSTORMS EV3 robotics kit to build the vehicle. The main brick, i.e., control center and power station for the robot is connected to two color sensors, one ultrasonic sensor and one gyro sensor. It has a steering actuator powered by a medium motor and a rear-wheel drive powered by a large motor. I programmed the robot to estimate the state of the parkours and navigate the desired path through the different sensors attached to it.
